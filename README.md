# whoPlayedWithMilesDavis

<work in progress>

Project that includes a PHP based webside, uses AJAX to dynamically update the page and a Postgresql database, to collect some of the musicians that played with Miles Davis.
Info and images are taken from Wikipedia.
CRUD functionality added, although still some issues to solve. In short:
Albums, tracks and musicians can be created, read, updated and deleted.
  
Since I am still working on this project, this readme file will contain more details about the project later.

Overview of the database (made with Lucidchart):

Importing a db.sql file:
```
psql -U username dbname < outfile.sql
```
